CSCI-305

10. When trying other words, I noticed the title gets into a loop where it repeats three words. This occurred a lot with the phrase “ready for you”.

14. Since it is taking the most common word each time, it is highly likely that it gets to the most common occurring bigrams.

15. No I was not able to, because I used words that were likely to occur multiple times.

16. NA (sorry)

19. Yes I got Bob Rogers every time.

20. “room view kill ape shall go my life less ordinary couple swells”

21. I like not having to put semicolons in Ruby, because it is one less thing to worry about.

22. I dislike not being able to put stops and starts in your code to debug it (maybe you can I did not figure that out).

23. I did not enjoy this lab, because I am still very confused on regular expressions.  I did like using a hash map for a more uncommon use.

24. 12+ hours

25. If I were to use Ruby again, I think it would be for regular expressions so I could practice more with this new syntax.
